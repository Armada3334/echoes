EBROW.EXE README

The exe version of Ebrow has been generated with PyInstaller
to run without need of having Python3.10++ preinstalled on Windows,
since it includes all the environment and dependencies needed.

Exception to this, is the assets/ folder needed to generate HTML reports,
for this reason it has been added in this folder separately.

The assets/ folder and its content must be copied under
C:\Program Files\GABB\echoes if you want to generate such reports.

If you installed the full bundle, that directory
is already present so the copy is not required. Otherwise it will.
