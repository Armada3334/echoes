Echoes it's a radio spectral analysis software for SDR devices, designed for meteor scattering purposes.

The older releases supported only RTL-SDR devices. They are very cheap SDR based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles 
based on Realtek's RTL2832U chipset. Starting from 0.50 Echoes embeds SoapySDR allowing the support of 
many other SDR flavors.

Echoes doesn't demodulate neither decode any human-made signal. Its main goal is to analyze and record the 
total power of natural signals and generate screenshots and tabular data (CSV) output in presence 
of particular peaks in a selected narrow range of frequencies. Since there is no demodulation, there is no 
provision for audio listening, except for a notify sound when an event has been recorded.

Since v.0.51 an external tool "Ebrow" is needed to process the collected data.
