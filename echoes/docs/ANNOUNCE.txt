Released Echoes 0.61 + Ebrow 0.2
This Echoes version is mostly a bugfix release, since it fixes the bug found in 0.60 (crash at midnight UTC when working with brand new databases) and the session table management (double session starts recorded).

A small change has been made here to dBfs scale offset control: now it accepts floats values instead of integers only, this allows a finer calibration (matching dBfs to dBm).
Still about calibration, a new page has been added to the website, for those interested in obtaining power data as dBm rather than dBfs to make them comparable with other stations.

Much more important were the changes to Ebrow, which concern, in addition to the correction of several bugs, the addition of new features, especially for statistics purposes. Starting from this version, I'll use the second field of the version number (release) for releases that introduce new features, setting the third number (update) to zero and then incrementing it when bugfixes will be released.

1-added solar_long and active_showers columns in the Chronological table along with sidereal time.
In addition to this, it is now possible to sort the chronological table differently by clicking on the column headers.

2-added the Attribute filters. Currently only 2 kind of filters have been defined: FreezeDetect that is ready to be used, and HasHead that is still under development.

3-it is now possible to reset the classification of a single event in Event details by setting its classification to None To make the classification filters tuning faster.

4-Added the Stop loading button in the Database tab to interrupt classifications or attribute calculation operations, which will be later saved in their current state. The next time the same DB is loaded, the interrupted operation will continue from where it was left off.

5-Added the Mass Indices calculation tables and graphs. The calculation can be both power-based or duration-based.

6-Added the events power distribution and duration distribution tables and graphs.

7-Added the events cumulative counts by power and by duration tables and graphs.

8-Added an integrated meteor shower calendar containing the radiant informations for the most important showers along the year (with ZHR >=10). The table can be sorted differently by clicking on column headers.

9-In the report page, changes have been made regarding the Preface, which is now also generated on xlsx reports. In addition, some macros have been defined that can be used inside the preface to print the value of internal variables, reducing the need to change manually the preface from one report to another.

Bugfix release Echoes 0.60
Fixed blobs deletion function - the bugfix in 0.59 was not so good.
r.size() could return -1 even if records are regularly present in result,
So - with large DBs - the deleting of expired screens and dumps did not happen
causing the continue growing of the DB

Bugfix release Echoes 0.59
Fixed blobs deletion function - crashes occurred the first time midnight swap was run on an brand new database,
due to assertion failed (Milan Kalina)

19/12/2024
Releasing Echoes 0.58 + Ebrow 0.1.83
This release includes several improvements I introduced in the last three months. Some of them have been tested directly on the GABB.IT station.
As for Echoes, we have the following changes that affect the graphical interface:

    Main window, the maximum limit of 366 days for the expiration of event data from the database has been increased to 3 years since the space they occupy is not as critical as the space occupied by dump files and screenshots.
    Waterfall window, a Reset button has been added that allows you to set back the zoom to 1X, the offset to zero and the detection interval to the center of the band, all with a single click.
    
    Frequency ruler, the way you drag the blue and red arrows has changed. To move them now you no longer need to hold down the left mouse button while dragging, but a first click is enough to select them and then be able to drag them without holding anything down. Once you reach the desired position, click the left mouse button again to confirm. This makes it easier to use laptops with a touchpad.
    
    For the red arrow and the overlying detection interval, it is now possible to adjust the frequency not only with the mouse but also with the +/- keys.
    
    The automatic thresholds are no longer defined as a percentage but - also for them - the LowerThreshold LT and UpperThreshold UT references are now set in dBfs, with the following meaning:
    The instantaneous lower threshold ILT is calculated as average difference AD + LT while the instantaneous upper threshold IUT is equal to ILT + UT.
    The result was that the thresholds that I previously used on the GABB.IT station (LT = 50% UT = 80%) became LT = 3 dBfs and UT = 3 dbFs too.
    This change was necessary because, using percentages, the distance between the two thresholds did not remain constant but varied with the variation of AD, and when its value approached zero the two thresholds were very close to each other, causing the false detection of multiple echoes instead of single overdense echoes.
    
    The Use direct buffers if available option in the Preferences tab has been removed as it added additional complication to the capture code without providing any significant benefits.
    
    When working with audio spectra, when zooming the waterfall the offset slider now stays aligned to the left instead of being centered as it does with radio spectra. As a result the displayed frequency range always includes the zero Hz at the far left of the ruler. Of course it is still possible to change the offset manually later.

Other improvements made to this version of Echoes concern the program's performance:

    A bug that caused waterfall slowdowns when using low sample rates (in the 225k-300k range of RTL-SDR devices) has been removed.
    
    The termination of an event catched by automatic thresholds is no longer tied only to the decrease of Average_S-N below the ILT but a second mandatory condition has been added: the standard deviation (of N) must decrease below a certain value that, for now, I have defined as double the average of the standard deviation:
    stdev < (2 x Average_stdev)
    The change was necessary because I found that certain overdense events are characterized by oscillations in the tail echo that can cause Average_S-N to drop below ILT even if the event is still in progress.
    
    A new command line option has been added: –vacuum, which allows Echoes to vacuum the database, which is necessary to remove expired screenshots and dump files from the sqlite file. In previous versions, vacuuming was performed by the same Echoes process running while it was performing the midnight swap. However, this caused acquisition blocks that resulted in fake events generated by Echoes itself. With the introduction of --vacuum, Echoes can now launch a parallel Echoes process to perform only the vacuum, while the main process performs the swap and keeps the acquisition running, significantly reducing the generation of these fakes.

About Ebrow, the main changes made are:

    The stale lock files are now removed when the referring processes are no longer running.
    
    Fixed the echoes.log generation under Windows.
    
    Improved xlsx report: added preface and added daily counts graph and RMOB summary image.
    
    Fixed a bug that caused incorrect counts when the timestamp published by SDR devices is unreliable. Ebrow now considers the time/date recorded by Echoes in its calculations and doesn't care of timestamps anymore besides recording them in DB.
    
    Added new statistical tables and graphs regarding the average power of events and their duration.



16/07/2024
Released Echoes 0.57 + Ebrow 0.1.82

These versions include some bufgixes that were the result of a remote debug session with the Calina Observatory in Lugano (CH), plagued by the presence of strong signals of human origin, one of which falls within the detection range for GRAVES and others located in the aeronautical band around 120MHz that cause frequent saturation of the receiver.
About the first signal, a notch filter had already been positioned in Echoes, but I also had to deactivate the anti-carrier filters CAR1 and CAR2, because the cancellation of the disturbance in the detection range was still mistaken for a carrier by these filters, thus discarding good events.
About the saturations instead, I was able to observe that due to their strict periodicity, the SAT filter in Ebrow was made to function poorly by taking for saturation what was not, and when a saturation event is taken as a good event, its N level is taken as a reference, ultimately discarding all subsequent events. The probability of this happening is quite high when the receiver saturates every twenty seconds - as in the case of Calina - for periods of several minutes.

The actual code change in Ebrow consists in adding a new parameter to the SAT anti-saturation filter. This parameter is a value of N to be used as a reference to detect sudden drops in N caused by receiver saturation, overriding the self-calculated N reference.

Of course, besides this software modification, installing a hardware bandpass filter becomes seriously recommended in cases like these.

In Ebrow has been also fixed the displaying of configuration tables, which now show the complete history of all changes made to the RTS file instead of the latest only, so that it is possible to trace how Echoes was configured when a certain event has been captured.

The fix made in Echoes instead concerns the saving of the changes made to the program configuration.
Every time you save the rts file after a configuration change, the revision number is incremented. All this must also apply to the database too, this because each event recorded in the database refers to a specific revision of the rts file.
However, this database update only occurred by saving the rts with a different name; so, further changes in the same rts could lead to crashes in Ebrow while trying to open that database. This shouldn't happen anymore. 



28/05/2024
Released Echoes 0.56 + Ebrow 0.1.80

This release of Echoes includes a better Airspy support, since I purchased one. 
My intention is to replace with it the Nongles N3 RTL-SDR on GABB.IT station. However, this won't happen before 
July 6, because I want to fill its database by covering an entire year using the same receiver. 
The rts file I used for my tests has been added to the project as TEST_AUTOMATIC_AIRSPY.rts.

The changes to Echoes code were necessary because using Airspy with Echoes 0.55 a crash occurred immediately upon 
startup, due - as I later discovered - to an error in the SoapyAirspy support library. The error has already been fixed 
in its sources repository https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/issues/433, however I still 
implemented a workaround in Echoes in order to avoid that error condition while working with released versions of SoapyAirspy
(its Windows DLL dates back to 2021).

Airspy also does not handle the tuning error compensation - or at least, its support library doesn't - so the relative control in
the device tab now gets disabled when opening an Airspy device.

New traces have been added to the dump file relating to the mean difference and the two thresholds so that they can be displayed on the power plot. The new traces have been added to both binary and ASCII dumps.

The cfg_prefs table is now updated every time the Echoes version changes. In this way, the Echoes version showed in Ebrow
is always up to date and doesn't need to make changes in the rts file to update it.

Other fixes were necessary due to the following bugs:
- crash that occurred when changing the open device via the device selector on the main window.
- crash occurred when using dongles equipped with an Elonics E4000 tuner (e.g. Funcube, Terratec DVB-T) when attempting to tune a frequency that fell within its 1GHz tuning hole.
- crash occurred when packets were received at UDP port 12345 in a format not recognized by Echoes. This crash has occurred often on the GABB.IT station in the last two months but I couldn't understand what was generating those packets; in any case after the fix the problem never recurred again.

About Ebrow, this version presents an interesting new feature: the automatic export of peculiar event screeshots and graphs while generating the HTML report. A example of such report can be seen at:  https://www.gabb.it/echoes/latest_report/

Besides this, other there are other news:
- the RFI filter now implements a better detection of repeating RFI patterns
- the events and statistic graphs now fit the entire pane at zoom  1x
- the RMOB counts can be compensated with sporadic background, to fix data affected by many fake events due e.g. to thunderstorms
- the progress bar now has been moved to the status bar, at window's bottom, in order to be visible regardless the selected tab.
- added 2 new pushbuttons to set the date coverage to last(current) month or last(current) year in one click.

Released Echoes 0.55 + Ebrow 0.1.77
This release is mainly for Ebrow but, having made two small changes to Echoes as well, I released both softwares, including all sources, the binary packages, and the bundle for Windows. They can be downloaded, as usual, from the project's files area (Echoes and bundle) and PyPI (Ebrow).
For those wondering what happened to Ebrow versions 0.1.71 to 0.1.76, these can be found on TestPyPi only, being test versions. You shouldn't download them, I only wrote this to say that you didn't miss anything with those versions.
Echoes has undergone two changes: the most obvious one was the addition of a new Scan Integration selector on the Preferences tab. This selector allows you to choose how the program should handle the case in which the waterfall refresh interval is slow enough that in the time it takes to display a scan, the radio sends more than one.
The second change is less obvious, but essential for the implementation in Ebrow of the new RFI filter, which I will write about in more detail below. This is the calculation of the standard deviation, that I had already foreseen for this purpose.
In recent months, the GABB.IT station has been subject to a boring disturbance that occurs at 20 UTC every Wednesday evening, lasting (fortunately) limited to around twenty minutes, but sufficient to trigger around fifty fakes that were not filtered sufficiently by the filters implemented in Ebrow.
Following tests carried out on GABB.IT I discovered that - for the purposes of discriminating that type of disturbance - it is more useful to calculate the standard deviation of N rather than S-N as happened on Echoes up to 0.54, so this change has been implemented in 0.55.
Ebrow also saw two changes: the first was the addition of the RFI fake filter to the classification filters as  mentioned above. This filter requires a standard deviation threshold as a parameter (RFI filter threshold), beyond which an event is declared fake RFI. For more details please check the online documentation about "Preferences" and the new "Fake events gallery" paragraph.
The second change concerns database handling. Ebrow versions up to 0.1.70 wrote into the database the the events classifications. 
To avoid conflicts with a running Echoes session, I normally opened a daily snapshot of the database, instead of the original one where Echoes writes. But in this way, I lost the classifications, because
they were stored in a snapshot that becomes quickly outdated. Tomorrow's snapshot wouldn't contain the classifications made today, so the classifications saving was a useless waste of time.
In version 0.1.77 I decided to no longer write to the database, but to only read it. However, Ebrow creates a cache file in JSON format containing the automatic_data table read from the database or from a snapshot and in which the classifications are written. In this way, when the database or a new snapshot of it is opened, Ebrow will first read the data from the cache file - a faster operation than querying the database - and then only the events that were not present in the cache will be read from the database and appended to the cache file afterwards. 
As a consequence of this change, the "Reload Database" button has been removed, while the "Update Database" button has changed function and now updates the cache file.
Another closed point, the version of Echoes and Ebrow showed in the reports and in RMOB diagrams has been corrected, i.e. "Echoes 0.51++" no longer appears but the version of Echoes actually used when generating the report, while the Ebrow version is shown complete, i.e. "0.1.77" instead of "0.1.x"
Finally, I discontinued the builds for Ubuntu 21.04 and added Ubuntu 23.10 and Raspbian 12 (both 32 and 64 bit versions)

Released Ebrow 0.1.70 and some other useful notes
this version is currently running on GABB.it station and fixes the bug that prevented the program from starting.  It is available on PyPI and SourceForge.
A clarification about sending data to RMOB:
Ebrow does not send data to the RMOB server on its own initiative. It is the user who must start periodically Ebrow and send the data by pressing the RMOB button or by launching the program with the --rmob option.
Alternatively, the user can configure the operating system to do this automatically. Under Windows this cam be done by using a "scheduled task", while on Linux this is done by programming a "crontab".
A note about my RPI 64bit image: 
Ebrow should run locally on the RPI to allow periodic data sending to RMOB via crontab. This means that the system must be configured to run the graphical system, since Ebrow needs an X server to run.
An X server can also be run remotely, instead of on the RPI, for instance on a Windows PC that runs VcxSrv (available on SourceForge). This allow to make the RPI run in the so called "full console mode" without an X server running aboard and still be able to run Ebrow locally by displaying its GUI on the remote PC. 
In this way, one can send RMOB data automatically even in full console mode, the drawback is that you need 2 computers working 24h for this.
A note about Raspbian 12:
Clint Parrish from Illinois asked for Raspbian12 Echoes binaries to be installed on its 5th generation RPI. 
Such binaries there will be, once the Opensuse Build System will fully support it. I use OBS to generate all the linux binary packages
available on SourceForge. Raspbian 12 is already a target, but  currently it fails the build due to lack of libliquid 1.3.2 or newer. This could be easily fixed from my side, but the worse is that in Raspbian12 repo he 64bit support is missing. When it will be available, it will be possible to generate both 32 and 64 bits packages.
About RPI5 performances with Echoes, Clint said:
"When you decide to move to the Pi 5 for your station, I recommend going with the 8 GB RAM.  Processes that I used to run on my Pi 4 with its 2 GB of RAM that took a long time now run on the Pi 5 so fast I blink and I miss it.  As for noise—I fought PoE noise from a security camera with my Echoes station for about  a month.  Two ferrite chokes on each end of the camera’s shielded Ethernet cable finally took care of it."

Released Ebrow 0.1.69
During the month of January I had to follow users eager to publish their counts on the RMOB server.
So, thanks to Tarcisio Bee (Astro Calina), Yves Robin, Frank Tyrlik and David Krembel and their reports , some flaws in Ebrow were found and corrected in four releases from 0.1.64 to 0.1.68.
The 0.1.69 fixes instead a bug regarding the last functionality added, the sporadic background calculation and its subtraction from statistic counts.
For users who want to install 0.1.69 in place of 0.1.63: I recommend deleting the keys
~~~
sporadicDates=
sporadicBackgroundDaily=
sporadicBackgroundByHour=
sporadicBackgroundBy10min=
~~~
from ebrow.ini, because their format has changed in 0.1.69 and the contents must be recalculated.
For Windows users: the most up-to-date configuration today is Echoes 0.54 + Ebrow 0.1.69, please to install these packages separately to stay tuned with development, since the bundled package won't be regenerated until the next Echoes release.



31/01/2024

Ebrow 0.1.67 released.  
This is another bugfix release, Ebrow 0.1.66 suffers for an incongruence in the code that stores/loads SB intervals from INI file. Now a database must be loaded before defining intervals and perform SB calculations.
The 0.1.67 is available on PyPI or - in windows exe form - in the files section, windows binaries.
Thanks to Yves Robin (La Garnache FR) for reporting the bugs.



21/01/2024

Hello,
I just released Ebrow 0.1.65, it can be downloaded from PyPI. 
And - right - I never announced the 0.1.64...
I'm getting some bug reports in these days (thanks to Frank Tyrlik, David Krembel and Tarcisio AstroCalina) that needed quick fixes.
The bugs were about database file opening that caused crash under certain conditions and other issues in report generation.
I won't release the windows bundle now.  In order to stay aligned with development, it's adviceable to install Echoes and Ebrow as separate packages, as described in online documentation.


04/01/2024

Hello,
Echoes 0.54 and Ebrow 0.1.63 have just been released. Sources and binaries are available for download from SourceForge, in *Files* section.
The changes made are the follows:
**Echoes 0.54 :**
- fixed the bug announced last December 12th regarding the failure to delete expired screenshots from the database.
- corrected the wrong counting of days to keep images in the database, before deleting them upon expiration. The error caused the images to be deleted a day earlier than required.
- Added two new controls on the main window, *Preferences* tab:
With a checkbox the possibility of using the old ASCII format for dumps (.DAT) is given instead of the new and more compact binary format DATB, because the old format can be read with GNUplot and other math tools, while the DATB is readable only with Ebrow.
A second control allows you to set a delay in microseconds between the sending of subsequent UDP datagrams. This parameter is considered only when using the UDP device.
**Ebrow 0.1.63:**
- the version number in the "Preferences" tab is now complete and displays all three version number fields ("0.1.63" instead of "0.1.x")
- implemented the possibility of calculating the daily sporadic background with resolution up to 10 minutes. The calculation is performed on specified day intervals and by applying the underdense and overdense filters separately.
- statistical tables and graphs can take this sporadic background into account and subtract it from the displayed counts. Depending on whether you are filtering the data by overdense, underdense or both, the sporadic background calculated with the matching  filters will be subtracted.
- fixed bug that caused a crash if you tried to open a freshly created database with no data inside.
-fixed bug in report generation, the station logo was not copied into the report assets, resulting in a message "logo not found".
Please note that the Raspberry PI images won't be updated.  Who desires to try them, will need to update the echoes+ebrow packages afterwards.

Hello,
The Ebrow release 0.1.62 for Windows has been loaded on Files area, together with a new bundle 0.53 including it. 
For Linux, the update can be made via *pip* as usual.
In this version, the  "Create Subset"  button is fully functional. Its purpose is to save a portion of the open 
 database, which can later be managed more quickly with Ebrow.  The portion will cover the days specified in "Time Coverage" control.
Enjoy



17/11/2023

Hello!
Echoes version 0.53 along with its data browser Ebrow 0.1.61 was released today on SourceForge. Ebrow can also be downloaded via PyPi.
Starting from this version, the format of the dump files changes: it will no longer be an ASCII file but a more compact binary file 
with the .DATB extension. Consequently, Ebrow 0.1.61 or later must be used to view the dumps of both formats (DAT /DATB).
A "Create Subset" button has also been added, the intention is to allow in the future the saving of portions of the database
 that can be opened more quickly with Ebrow. Development of the feature is still ongoing, so all you can do with this button is ignore it.


05/10/2023

Hello,
Echoes 0.52 has just been released
. 
This is a bugfix version, no new features have been added. 
Insertion of new events in database has been improved by adding a queuing mechanism to manage the failed insertions due to temporary database unavailabilities. These can happen while accessing the database with Ebrow when acquisition is still running.
Released also the Raspberry-PI 64bit ready SD-card image containing Raspberry PI OS 11 64bit and the Echoes 0.52 + Ebrow 0.1.59 + RMOBclient_arm64 0.1 suite. 
https://sourceforge.net/.../SD%20card%20ready%20image/
Read the dcumentation at https://www.gabb.it/echoes for further details.



02/10/2023

Ebrow version 0.1.59 has been released. It fixes a bug that caused the program to crash immediately upon startup, the first time you installed it on a computer that had never hosted Ebrow
 (thanks to Tarcisio - astrocalina.ch - for the report).
This version also includes the new --multiple command line option that allows you to bypass the single instance constraint (see the online manual for more detail)


20/09/2023

Good morning,
I have released a version of Ebrow, 0.1.54, which adds the following new features:
1-the possible presence in the database of incomplete events, i.e. NOT associated with three records (Raise, Peak, Fall), no longer causes errors in the program. They remain in the sqlite3 file but are ignored by Ebrow. Below I will explain why these things happen.
2-I added a bar to view the progress of the DB loading/updating and event classification operations.
As to date, on our GABB.IT station, they take several minutes and the spinwheel is not reassuring enough.
3-An error in the saturation filter (SAT) has been corrected. If you update to this version, remember to change the filter intervention threshold to an initial value of 2%, and change it later if you are not satisfied.
Going back to point 1, I verified on our station that incomplete records are caused by Echoes if it were to run simultaneously with Ebrow. In our case, this happens once an hour, to update the counts on RMOB, to which is added the creation of the report once a day.
The database works in WAL mode; this allows the simultaneous writing and reading of a sqlite3 database by two different processes running on the same machine.
Echoes only writes to the database, so everything works fine as long as Ebrow just reads it. However, when you run it with the --rmob and --report options, Ebrow classifies the events detected in the time since its last execution and implicitly saves them to the database file, so it also performs writes.
When this happens, and Echoes detects a new event, it also attempts to write the rising edge record to the DB and receives a rejection. After a succession of 10 failed attempts spaced 5 seconds apart, Echoes gives up and tries to write the peak record and maybe this time he makes it, or maybe not. The same thing can also happen with the falling edge.
In this way, incomplete events or jumps in the progressive numbering of the IDs can be created. Also the lasting time calculation gets completely broken, since it counts also the time taken to write into the database.
The next version of Echoes (0.52) will therefore include a fix for this problem.
Giuseppe


3/8/2023 - Released Echoes 0.51

Hello,
The version 0.51 of Echoes, released today, introduces important changes in its way of working, which can be summarized in the following points:                
            
-Windows binaries built with MSVC: it will be possible to use the PothosSDR support libraries to interface your SDR, 
therefore I am no longer required to regenerate these libraries with MinGW to allow them to be used by Echoes.
Note that, since PothosSDR publishes only 64 bit DLLs, a 32bit version of Echoes for Windows will not be produced. 
                  
-Separation of data acquisition and processing: data processing tasks (classification, archiving, report generation) has been moved
to a second program called Ebrow, to be installed separately.
                   
-Integrated RMOB support. Generation of the monthly counts TXT, the summary image and sending to RMOB's FTP server.
                 
-Report generation, in HTML and XLSX formats.

The last two are in fact Ebrow's features.

The new online manual has been integrated in the new Echoes website, still located under http://www.gabb.it/echoes where you can collect more detailed information.



29/4/2022 - Released Echoes 0.50

Hello,

Echoes 0.50 has been released today.
No, you haven't missed anything, there is nothing in the middle between 0.33 and this version.

I thought it made sense to mark the difference with the previous version because
the switch from supporting RTL-SDR devices only to supporting different types of SDRs
(in theory all those for which an open source SoapySDR driver exists)
it's too big a leap to fit into a simple version increment. 

In addition to SoapySDR support, this release includes other improvements:

-Increased scrolling speed.

-Thresholds can be displayed both in the power history graph and Power 2D plots

-Added two new buttons in main window, "Help" to open the online manual and
"Save"

-The frequency scale markers (center frequency, notches and peak detection interval boundaries) are now draggable with the mouse.

-Added a popup window to show, by right-clicking on the waterfall, the frequency at mouse position.

-Screenshots are now archived keeping the original file date and time.

-The *rts* files have improved their human readability but beware: they're only partially compatible with 0.33 rts files.

-Added support for audio spectra (with zero Hz at left) that gets enabled when the *SoapyAudio* device is selected.

-Two controls have been added in main window to calibrate the dBfs gain and offset.

-The full report can now be required manually without having to stop the acquisition.

-Added notification sound for *Acquisition fault* errors (SDR faulty or disconnected)

Finally, for those who - unlike me - use real SDRs (i.e. born for this purpose):
keep in mind that I have NEVER tried the program with anyone else
device other than RTL-SDR and my laptop's audio, so don't be surprised by any program's malfunctions
arising with your SDR plugged in, but let me know what happens to you, so that I can
help you understand how to fix the problem. The reference SoapySDR's version is 0.8.

Warning for Linux users: to make SoapySDR work, you have to install the Soapy support library for your SDR. When 
you install the package, the support library is not included as automatic dependency because
it depends on the SDR device you intend to use with Echoes.

have fun!
GMB



17/9/2021 - Released Echoes 0.33

Hello,

This release fixes the known bugs of 0.32 (see also KNOWN_BUGS) and no new functionalities.
In fact, the classic Echoes that you know, based on librtlsdr and working with RTL-SDR only
reached the terminus. Further 0.3x releases, if any, will be only for urgent bugfixes.

Despite this, it is still worth installing this version because the bugs fixed were noticeable:

1. Changing the bandwidth while acquisition is running causes the immediate frequency ruler update, while the 
downsampling rate was updated at acquisition restart. This behavior was confusing and has been fixed.

2. In manual shots, the instant spectra diagram didn't appear

3. A bug in subsampling code caused the average noise N to increase a lot when subsampling was switched on and 
 set with a narrower band than sample rate.
 
4. An error in stddev calculation caused the waterfall display loop to run 3..4 times slower than due, depending of
the chosen configuration

5. Generating reports on machines equipped with small displays (height < 900 pixel) the colorgramme-like graphs resulted
cropped. 

The future releases from 0.50 will be SoapySDR-based. Being a higher level library than 
librtlsdr, it will support many more devices than RTL-SDR dongles. But this is another story.

Have fun,
GMB


1/5/2021 - Released Echoes 0.32

Hello,
This release contains three news:
the most important is that the peak detection interval is no more sticky at waterfall's center.
A new slider has been added, just above the frequency scale, to shift the red and blue arrows leftwards or rightwards. Its purpose is to allow capturing head echoes with high doppler, a cool sport that needs a really good hardware and antenna equipment to gain medals. It's not my case, but I hope somebody out there could experiment and enjoy this feature. You can take a look at IU2EFA site to better understand what I mean.
The other two are minor changes that I planned time ago and at last have been implemented.

-Two vertical lines on the waterfall mark the boundaries of the peak detection area, together with the two blue arrows on frequency scale. Like the arrows, they cannot be dragged with the mouse (yet) but can be hidden, if desired, by unchecking a box in Preferences tab.

-By clicking on the waterfall, a tooltip appears showing the frequency and the time of the point clicked. Obviously if acquisition is running, the point scrolls immediately below so the time information makes sense only with acquisition stopped.

Important bug fix: the background noise N level changed when resizing the waterfall window and the frequency zoom factor and this was not good. The N level should change only acting on the sample rate, bandwidth or FFT controls. Fixing this issue required
a partial redesign of the waterfall functionality but now it has been completed.

Another bug was about the usage of the error correction factor: the integer part is applied immediately to the dongle HW, while the fractional part, that is managed in software, needed acquisition restart to be applied and this caused some confusion. Now instead, both the parts are applied immediately once entered in the Error Correction control.

Finally, the HDD available space controls have been moved from Output to Preferences tab, in order to keep the main window height below 600 pixels and avoid the vertical shrinking that causes the acquisition radiobuttons to disappear.

Have fun,
GMB


10/4/2021 - Released Echoes 0.31

Hello,
The binaries of Echoes 0.31 have just ben uploaded on Files section.
This release fixes three bugs, two of them are related to client/server functionality - and probably I'm
the unique user who noticed them. The third instead caused the loss of the echo head when the echo lasts
longer than one screen, so the fix was more urgent.
Have fun
GMB

19/3/2021 - Released Echoes 0.30
Fixed a bug in automatic report production: only one report could be produced, the 
periodicity was broken. The next report date coverage was updated only on GUI without
practical effects.

6/3/2021 - Released Echoes 0.29

Just another bugfix release, with no new features added. The fixed bugs are listed in KNOWN_BUGS
(related to 0.28) and CHANGES (fixes to 0.29).
Hah... another bugfix release, Echoes 0.29 has just been published.  Bugfixing distracts me from implementing new features,  
and there is one in particular that has been waiting for months now: the Soapy SDR library integration 
to support several SDR devices than RTL-SDR dongles, like Airspy for instance 
(ps. Thanks Vainer Orlando for lending me your Airspy, I hope I don't have to keep it for long!)

2/3/2021 - Released Echoes 0.28

This is a bugfix release, with no new features added. The fixed bugs are listed in KNOWN_BUGS
(related to 0.27) and CHANGES (fixes to 0.28).

29/1/2021 - Releasing Echoes 0.27

The most relevant changes in this version are the following. For more details, check CHANGES.txt,
or the Wiki.

Added sample rate downsampler to perform FFT on a narrower band than the entire sample rate. 
The old "bandwidth" control in waterfall window is now called "zoom" because the real bandwidth, 
result of the downsampling, is tuned in main window "FFT" tab. 

Added support for device "UDP server" that is another Echoes instance whose IP address has been 
specified in "preferences" tab. An Echoes instance connected to an UDP server becomes an UDP client.
The UDP client clones the settings in "device" tab directly from the server, while all the other
controls can be changed and saved independently.

Reporting: the colors scale used in hourly count tables (Colorgramme lookalike) are no more absolute 
but relative to the minimum/maximum value included in the report: the black value means zero, 
red is the maximum value.

In "preferences" tab is possible to choose an alternate "Black&white" waterfall palette, besides 
the classical "Color"

The ODT manual has been replaced by a Wiki, published on Echoes Sourceforge pages. A snapshot of 
the wiki is deployed with the software as wikimanual.pdf.

WARNING: the RTS files produced with past Echoes releases are no more compatible, so the advice is to
start with one of the test rts included in the package then customize and save it with another name.

Another WARNING: known bug: under Windows, the first time Echoes is launched after fresh install, 
when quitting the application (pressing Quit button) a segmentation fault occurs.
This happens only once. Further sessions will be terminated regularly.



31/5/2019  - Echoes 0.26 is out.

This release contains the following new features and fixes:

1-There is a new of thresholds mode: besides absolute and differential (the default)
I introduced the "automatic" mode (be careful about confusion with the word "automatic",
already used for acquisition). In this mode the thresholds must be specified as percentage
of variation of instantaneous S-N against the average S-N, resulting in mobile thresholds
that can self-increment or self-decrement depending of variations of the noise level
along the day, preventing many fake captures.
The mode can be selected in the Preferences tab. Obviously, each time this preference
is changed, the thresholds values in Output tab must be adjusted.

2-The postprocess carriers filter, introduced in 0.25, can now be excluded from GUI by
unchecking the apposite checkbox in Reports tab.

3-A new postprocess filter has been added, suited for lightings, artificial electrostatic
discharges and other kinds of disturbances producing an horizontal pattern covering
the entire waterfall's bandwidth. This filter can be excluded by unchecking the apposite
checkbox in Reports tab.

4-In HTML report the color scale used in counting tables now matches the Colorgramme scale
and the zero value is rendered in black. The table orientation remains the same.

5-Fixed the calculation of interval areas and echo areas in CSV reports; the lightings
filter is based on these values and a wrong calculation caused the filter to fail sometimes.

6-On the waterfall, the average S-N difference value, used as reference for automatic thresholds (1),
is now displayed at the right-top corner (brown color)

7-Still on waterfall, at bottom side, near the event counter, the geographical coords of the
station have been added, since it can be an useful info to keep in the screenshots. The
coords must be set in Reports/SiteInfo dialog.

The sources and binaries for Windows and some Linux distros and architectures, including RaspberryPI
have been placed in files section. As usual, the ArchPI binaries will follow few days later.

Finally, please note that the english manual has been updated to 0.26, while the translations have
been left out-of-date.



14/2/2019 - Echoes 0.25 is out.

	The 0.25 has just been released for all the platforms and architectures supported, Raspberry included.
	this release fixes the bug mentioned in this post:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/echoes/discussion/knownbugs/thread/fcc31d0eaa/
	( a missed signal/slot connection could cause problems in program initialization. )


24/12/2018 - Echoes 0.24 is out.

The changes are:

- fixed bug: the files in archive older than the expiration date weren't deleted
- fixed bug: statistic CSV: when two consucutive peaks were joined, the area echo and 
  area interval fields could assume negative values
- improved false positive filtering in automatic mode: besides event lasting, 
  through some calculation now Echoes can discriminate most of false positives due 
  to Graves carrier (still TODO: make editable the filter parameters)
- added two new preferences:
	enable event notification sound ("ping") and
	absolute thresholds (to apply the thresholds on S value instead of S-N)
- the instantaneous S, N and S-N values are now showed at right-top corner of
  waterfall window. When taking a shot, the values showed are the peak ones,
  in order to match the instantaneous spectra graph at window's bottom.  



03/10/2018 - Echoes 0.23 is out.

fixed the following bugs:
- automatic report not working under linux
- after an acquisition session longer than 1 day it is possible
  to generate a manual report (by pressyng the button). 
  This didn't work if echoes is restarted before pressing 
  the report button

11/8/2018 - Echoes 0.22 is out.

The changes are:

- statistic CSV: added 3 new columns:
    - area echo interval: is the area covered by the rectangle having height equal 
    to event lasting and width equal to detection interval. The ratio between the 
    area covered by the echo and this area is useful to discriminate fake events.
    - peaks count : counts all the peaks that crossed the higher threshold, including
    the maximum peak. It's another useful data for events discrimination.
    - LOS (Line Of Sight) speed of the event, calculated from its Doppler shift.

- added a control to reserve an amount of disk space to be kept free, in MB. If the
available space falls below this limit, the acquisition stops spontaneously.

- thresholds controls now allow to set values with one decimal, for a finer thresholds tuning.

- PPM error compensation now allows 2 decimals precision. The integer part is set in hardware,
as in previous versions. The decimal part instead is used to apply a transparent offset to the
waterfall.

- the N filtering has been replaced by a sliding average of the last n scans, where n is
the value set in spinbox.

- added an archive flattening button, that allows to specify a single directory where to copy
the entire content of the hierarchical archive of the current configuration. Only the files together,
without subdirectories. This is useful to build a video joining the images.

- now it's possible to mix all the three kinds of plots in the same full report. The gnuplot data files
generated in different days with different plot types can be mixed in the same full report.
The previous versions instead plotted all the files using the format set when the report has
been requested.

- automatic report generation: a checkbox has been added to set this feature. The acquisition
stops at midnight UTC, the reports are generated, the files of the day are archived then
the acquisition restarts automatically


15/5/2018 - Echoes 0.21 is out.

The changes applied to 0.20 toward 0.21 have been the following:

1- daily archive feature

2-"Join time" parameter to set the minimum time distance between consecutive unrelated 
echoes

3-updated manuals (english and italian)

4-reorganized some controls, moved from output tab to preferences tab.




21/2/2018 - Echoes 0.20 is out

A new release of Echoes called 0.20 can be now downloaded from the SF Files Section.

The changes applied to 0.19 toward 0.20 have been the following:

1-Corrected manual, par.7.1
(“Stop after...” in place of “Shot duration”).

2-Progressive event count is zeroed at midnight and a new CSV statistic 
files is created.

3-Improved readability in fullreport: the checkbox values
 are no more reported as numeric 0/2 values but strings "NO/YES".
 
4-Fullreport files have now a naming convention, no more fullreport.html.
 
5-Fixed .plt files to generate graph titles regularly formatted (In 0.19
the graphs titles looked very strange).

6-The waterfall window can be shrinked enough to fit netbooks screens.

7-The customizable logo set in Site Infos dialog is now showed
on waterfall window too, and catched in screenshots.

8-Corrupted CSV files caused crash while stopping acquisition, in 
postprocessing phase. Fixed by skipping the malformed records.

9-HTML files are resources. No more need to install them. 

10-IQ buffers have now tunable size, the default is still 100% that
is the hardcoded value in 0.19.

11-Added notch filters, they can be added by right-clicking on ruler.

12-Added some more checkboxes to report tab to allow generating reports
with only plots included (no screenshots) and to restart acquisition
automatically after report generation.

13-Removed obsolete preference (autoclean).

14-Changed RTS file structure, now is subdivided in sections. The example
RTS files have been updated to this new format.

For more details, please check the updated manuals.

Enjoy!
