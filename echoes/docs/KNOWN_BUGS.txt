Known bugs
-----------------------------
21.02.2021  0.27

1. The Error Compensation control in main window doesn't work, due to a wrong slot signature. 

2. Under Windows, the first time Echoes is launched after fresh install, when quitting the application 
(pressing Quit button) a segmentation fault occurs. This happens only once. Further sessions will be terminated regularly.

3. Due to a mistake in the device detection code, the NESDR dongle cannot work (problem reported by Alec Alden).

4. The TEST_*.rts files are completely broken and could work with test_patterns only.

5. The default main window vertical size is too small and the content of acquisition mode box under 
Output tab is not visible (problem reported by Alec Alden).

1. When a rts file is loaded from command line, with option -s, the tune offset is not restored. 

2. When a rts file is loaded from command line, with option -s and the plugged-in dongle doesn't match the device 
   mentioned in the rts, the program selects automatically the test_patterns instead of the new dongle and loses the
   loaded settings.
   
3. Starting acquisition in console mode, a fake endless event is detected at startup, the program is useless in this way.

4. Setting a data dump coverage higher than 20s causes a file cut, each dump lasts 20s max, depending of the delay set, 
   the dumps could not contain echoes.

1. Automatic report is triggered one time only. The coverage dates for the next report are updated on the GUI but not in internal settings 
neither in rts file, so there won't be another trigger. As temporary workaround, the next report dates must be entered manually in 
main window Report tab each time an automatic report has been produced.

1. In automatic acquisition, the long lasting echoes are split on multiple screenshots depending of the refresh time chosen, but
the head echo is often lost, because Echoes waits for an event to be expired before triggering the shot. This wait will be removed.

2. In client/server configuration, in case of interation with the server's GUI, the power history diagram of the client goes nuts.

3. Still in client/server configuration, besides the controls in Device tab, also the FFT resolution increment/decrement should be locked, 
because the size of the buffers sent by the server are tailored in base of server's FFT resolution.

1. The background noise N changes while resizing the waterfall window and the frequency zoom factor. 

2. The Error Compensation is applied in different times; the integer part is applied istantaneously because 
it's performed dongle's hardware, while the fractional part is performed by software and requires acquisition restart
to be applied. This generates some confusion, even because the hardware correction seems not so accurate. I tested three
different RTLSDR and I found that for all those devices, it makes no difference to set +0.0  or +1.0 - no corrections are applied,
while other values are, but the shift in Hz respect the +0.0 value varies. 
I.E. at 143 Mhz 1 ppm = 143 hz but the real shift varies between 100..200 Hz per step and it's neither constant 
(see also: https://www.rtl-sdr.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4761)

17.09.2021  0.32

1. Changing the bandwidth while acquisition is running causes the immediate frequency ruler update, while the 
downsampling rate is updated at acquisition restart. This behavior is confusing and must be fixed.

2. In manual shots, the instant spectra diagram doesn't appear

3. A bug in subsampling code causes the average noise N to increase a lot when subsampling was switched on,
 with narrower band than sample rate.
 
4. An error in stddev calculation causes the waterfall display loop to run 3..4 times slower than due. 

5. Generating reports on machines equipped with small displays (height < 900 pixel) the colorgramme-like graphs results
cropped. 

-----------------------------
19.04.2022  0.33

1. some downsampling frequencies/FFT resolution combinations result in a buggy behavior - the downsampled signals
appear on variable frequencies depending of the downsampling rate.

2. the spectra still scrolls too slowly to allow catching head echoes.

-----------------------------

1. Raspberry PI+RTLSDR : if direct buffers are enabled, the waterfall shows nothing.

Listing the bugs here no longer makes much sense since they are reported both on the homepage www.gabb.it/echoes 
and on the Facebook page. This file is kept here for historical reasons only
